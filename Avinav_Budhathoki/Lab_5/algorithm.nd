# Algorithm for Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm with 2D Transformations

## Input:
- Start point of the line: `(x1, y1)`
- End point of the line: `(x2, y2)`
- 2D transformation matrices for scaling, translation, rotation, and composite transformations

## Output:
- Original line and its transformed version plotted

## Steps:

### Step 1: Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm (BLDA)
1. Compute the absolute differences in \( x \) and \( y \):
   - \( dx = |x2 - x1| \)
   - \( dy = |y2 - y1| \)
2. Determine the direction of movement:
   - \( sx = 1 \) if \( x2 > x1 \), else \( sx = -1 \)
   - \( sy = 1 \) if \( y2 > y1 \), else \( sy = -1 \)
3. Initialize the starting point as \( x = x1 \) and \( y = y1 \).
4. Initialize empty lists for storing points: `xes` and `yes`.
5. Depending on whether \( dx \geq dy \):
   - **If \( dx \geq dy \):**
     - Set decision parameter \( p = 2 \times dy - dx \).
     - Loop \( dx + 1 \) times to calculate the line points.
   - **Else:**
     - Set decision parameter \( p = 2 \times dx - dy \).
     - Loop \( dy + 1 \) times to calculate the line points.
6. Append each calculated point to `xes` and `yes`.

### Step 2: Apply 2D Transformations
1. Stack the points into a \( 3 \times n \) matrix to enable homogeneous transformations:
   - Add a row of ones to the points.
2. Define transformation matrices:
   - **Scaling matrix**: Adjust the size of the line.
   - **Translation matrix**: Move the line to a new position.
   - **Rotation matrix**: Rotate the line around the origin.
   - **Composite transformation matrix**: Combine translation, rotation, and inverse translation.
3. Apply the transformation by matrix multiplication:
   - Multiply the transformation matrix with the points matrix.
   - Extract transformed \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates.

### Step 3: Plot the Original and Transformed Lines
1. Use `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot:
   - The original line points as a solid blue line.
   - The transformed line points as a dashed red line.
2. Add labels, a legend, and grid to enhance visualization.

### Step 4: Display the Result
- Show the plotted graph with the original and transformed lines.
